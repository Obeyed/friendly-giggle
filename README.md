Learning Haskell by following the course at [CIS194](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/%7Ecis194/spring13/lectures.html) from Penn Engineering.

I'm running my code in a Docker container with `docker run -it --rm -v ${PWD}:/data/ haskell:8`.
From the GHCi I load and compile files with `:l /data/homework/01-intro.hs`
